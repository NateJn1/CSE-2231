Each of the files attached show proficiency in some aspect of Java and sorting algorithms for faster searches.

All of these except the SJC file uses OSU Component libraries. They are similar to standard java libraries, but were altered for the use of teaching students like me. 

BinarySearchTreeMethods

This file shows the use of not only Binary Search Trees, a sorting algorithm that can quickly find things, but also the ability to create methods given pre-existing components. 

BLParser

This file is learning how parsing works. While it isn't very applicable to every day use of coding, it was possibly the hardest concept to learn. It uses many recursive calls and a significant amount of dedication to get correct. Overall, it displays my abilities as a programmer.

MapWithHashing

This file uses hashing, another concept in Java that helps store things in an easy to find way.

TagCloudGeneratorSJC

This file is a standard java library file. It shows many of the concepts used throughout the other files as well as the use of the standard java library.
